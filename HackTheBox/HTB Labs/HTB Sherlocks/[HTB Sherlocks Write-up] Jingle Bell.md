**Scenario:**
Torrin is suspected to be an insider threat in Forela. He is believed to have leaked some data and removed certain applications from their workstation. They managed to bypass some controls and installed unauthorised software. Despite the forensic team's efforts, no evidence of data leakage was found. As a senior incident responder, you have been tasked with investigating the incident to determine the conversation between the two parties involved.

>Task 1: Which software/application did Torrin use to leak Forela's secrets?

We only have 1 artifact avaliable here which is Windows Notifications database

So after opened it with DB Browser for SQLite, go to Notification table and then you will see a lot of slack notification stored here.

>Task 2: What's the name of the rival company to which Torrin leaked the data?

When inspect value inside we can see unfamiliar name which should be the rival company at this point

I was too swayed with arrival time in this table but the real one was this which is unix timestamp

asked ChatGPT to write me a script then here we go
```
from datetime import datetime

# The given timestamp
epoch_time = 1681986889.660179

# Convert the epoch time to a UTC datetime
utc_time = datetime.utcfromtimestamp(epoch_time)

# Print the result
print("UTC Time:", utc_time)
```
