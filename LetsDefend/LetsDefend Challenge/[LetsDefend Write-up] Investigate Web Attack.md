## Start Investigation
Let's start unzip and open this log file!

At first glance, it seems that this website has been targeted by Nikto, a web vulnerability scanner, as indicated by the user-agent identified in the web server logs.

The observed activity aligns with characteristics typically associated with the Nikto tool. The tool seems to be conducting web reconnaissance through directory brute-forcing.

After discovering directories, it appears that there have been multiple attempts at accessing `/bWAPP/login.php`. This suggests the possibility of a brute force attack targeted at the login page.

After scrolling through the logs, I found a HTTP 302 status codes (Redirects), indicating that the attacker has successfully brute-forced their way through.

After successfully gaining access to the website through brute force attacks, the attacker identified a code injection vulnerability through `whoami` command. Subsequently, they attempted to exploit this vulnerability to inject code and establish persistence by adding a user to the system.
