An [attachment](https://static.n00bzunit3d.xyz/Crypto/Vinegar/enc.txt) got us ciphertext and a key to decrypt it then after reviewing challenge name again, this one should be vigenere cipher

So I went to https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher to decode it and sure enough, this one is vigenere cipher

```

The cryptography category is incomplete without RSA. So here is a simple RSA challenge. Have fun! Author: noob_abhinav

![7f602cc4944794a45d74671227358dbb.png](../_resources/7f602cc4944794a45d74671227358dbb.png)

An [attachment](https://static.n00bzunit3d.xyz/Crypto/RSA/encryption.txt) got us everything we need to decrypt ciphertext to plaintext again, here are what we got
- e is public exponent (used for encryption)
- n is modulus
- c is ciphertext 

Because e is 3 (small number) then if plaintext is also small enough, we can decrypt ciphertext easily by computing the integer cube root of c

and here is the python script that will do just that
```
import gmpy2

# Given values
e = 3
n = 135112325288715136727832177735512070625083219670480717841817583343851445454356579794543601926517886432778754079508684454122465776544049537510760149616899986522216930847357907483054348419798542025184280105958211364798924985051999921354369017984140216806642244876998054533895072842602131552047667500910960834243
c = 13037717184940851534440408074902031173938827302834506159512256813794613267487160058287930781080450199371859916605839773796744179698270340378901298046506802163106509143441799583051647999737073025726173300915916758770511497524353491642840238968166849681827669150543335788616727518429916536945395813

# Compute cube root
m, exact = gmpy2.iroot(c, e)

if exact:
    print("The message is:", m)
else:
    print("No direct cube root found, message might be larger.")

# Assuming m is found and is an integer
plaintext = m.to_bytes((m.bit_length() + 7) // 8, 'big')
print("Decoded message:", plaintext.decode())
```

Then execute it to get a flag

### Vinegar 2 (360 points)
![10648c980ce2658350931614eb2abe78.png](../_resources/10648c980ce2658350931614eb2abe78.png)

We were provided with a script to encrypt content of a flag to ciphertext and a ciphertext 

And since we already got a key and know which encryption that was using, we can write a new script to reverse it back to plaintext like this
```
alphanumerical = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890!@#$%^&*(){}_?'
matrix = []
for i in alphanumerical:
    matrix.append([i])

idx=0
for i in alphanumerical:
    matrix[idx][0] = (alphanumerical[idx:len(alphanumerical)] + alphanumerical[0:idx])
    idx += 1

key = '5up3r_s3cr3t_k3y_f0r_1337h4x0rs_r1gh7?'
ciphertext = '*fa4Q(}$ryHGswGPYhOC{C{1)&_vOpHpc2r0({'

assert len(key) == len(ciphertext)

key_arr = []
for y in key:
    for i in range(len(alphanumerical)):
        if matrix[i][0][0] == y:
            key_arr.append(i)

dec_arr = []
for i in range(len(ciphertext)):
    char = ciphertext[i]
    key_index = key_arr[i]
    for j in range(len(alphanumerical)):
        if matrix[j][0][key_index] == char:
            dec_arr.append(matrix[j][0][0])
            break

decrypted_flag = ''.join(dec_arr)
print(decrypted_flag)
```

Execute it to get a flag

```

## Forensics
### Plane (176 points)

So many plane-related challenges! Why not another one? The flag is the latitude, longitude of the place this picture is taken from, rounded upto two decimal places. Example: n00bz{55.51,-20.27}. Author: NoobMaster Author: NoobMaster

This challenge is not "OSINT" but "FORENSICS" so we must exiftool to find GPS Position when taking this photo

Then use https://www.gps-coordinates.net/ to get latitude and longtitude of this position which we can see that it landed us with the most favorite number of all CTF players 

```
n00bz{13.37,-13.37}

We were given source code of targeted website which we will need to bypass login page to admin user authorized page and get a flag but we could not login as admin directly but we will need to get correct `uid` so we can skip login process and go straight to that page to retrieve a flag

We know that `uid` was generated by `uuid5` with `leet` and `username` as parameters and we already know both of them so we can create a script to generate `uid` for us like this

```
import uuid

leet = uuid.UUID('13371337-1337-1337-1337-133713371337')
admin_username = 'admin123'
admin_uuid = uuid.uuid5(leet, admin_username)
print(admin_uuid)
```

Execute it to get `uid` of an admin

Go straight to this page and get a flag

```
n00bz{1337-13371337-1337-133713371337-1337} 
```

Just go to my pastebin which was created long time back.
Note:- https://pastebin.com/u/abhinav654321 New info:- https://pastebin.com/j1UnKA7m

Since this link is already taken down, we will need to use waybackmachine

Someone already created snapshot for us so we just have to visit that specific snapshot and get a flag right there

```

### Vacation (126 points)

My friend told me they were going on vacation, but they sent me this weird PowerShell script instead of a postcard! Author: 0xBlue

We were given a powershell script that convert content of a flag with XOR and save it to `output.txt` 

![5cf30b863644e39909974e7c7612c41e.png](../_resources/5cf30b863644e39909974e7c7612c41e.png)

So we just need to convert it back to plaintext with XOR recipe with 3 as a key
