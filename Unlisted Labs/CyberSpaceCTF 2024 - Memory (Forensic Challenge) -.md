I left the image of the flag in the desktop but somehow it disappeared, can you help me recover it?

This challenge is quite unique, We were provided with Windows Memory dump and tasked to restore a file from "Desktop" < which is a big hint right here so we wanted to use `mftparser` and `filescan` and attempt to restore that file from provided memory dump (if its still there).

First, lets get to know about system of this memory dump first with `file` and it telling us that this memory dump is MS Windows 64bit crash dump so I used Volatility 3 with `windows.info` plugin next to find OS version which helped me determine suitable profile for Volatility 2.

From this result, I finally decided which profile to use which is `--profile=Win10x64_18362`

I always started with `pstree` to show any suspicious processes that I might want to look deep into and from this result, I wanted to dig into is `notepad.exe` and `WINWORD.EXE` despite knowing that they probably not associated directly with flag image.

I used `cmdline` plugin next to show command-line arguments of each process and from this result, it telling me that there is one more file on "Desktop" that I might want to look into.

I used `mftparser` plugin to dump master file table record to a text file and find for any files reside in "Desktop" folder. and look like `note.txt` is not containing any hint nor an actual flag for us.

But there is one particular file that made me think, I was on the right track which is `flag.enc` but I could not dump this file using `dumpfiles` plugin since `filescan` plugin could not find this file from this memory dump.

There is a hint from the file extension indicates that this file could be an image file I was looking for but it was encrypted with some algorithms.

So I used `flag.enc` to search for anything from this memory dump which landed me with a powershell script responsible for encryption.

After reviewing this script, We can see that this script used AES CBC Mode to encrypt `flag.jpg` and stores ciphertext, encryption key and IV on environment variables and eventually deleted `flag.jpg`

I used `envars` plugin (of volatility 2) to get these variables but It did not print out full content of `ENCD` and it could not retrieve other 2 variables.

So I had to get these variable directly from memory dump.

These 3 variables were declared together so I expected that at the end of `ENCD` should follow by `ENCK` and `ENCV`.

But when I tried to restore this image, it was corrupted and I had no way to solve so I went to sleep and forgot that this CTF was about to end.

A thought came in my mind after I woke up (CTF has ended already) that maybe DATA craving via HxD and volatility 2 are not work then how about volatility 3?

After I tried `vol3 -f mem.dmp windows.envars > envars.txt` with `grep "ENC" envars.txt` then I finally realized that sometimes I just need to calm down and explore which options I have before give up on anything.

So finally I got 3 variables from the same process (different process might have different ciphertext, key and IV) then came back to CyberChef to retrieve a flag. (too late, CTF already ended LOL)

Here is All Recipes I used on CyberChef.

I also read write-up wrote by other team after this and realized, every team used Volatility 3 to solve this challenge.

Which made me realized that I really need to know tools and their capabilities so I will not have to waste my time and hit the wall again.
